## Project Overview

CONNECT is a platform where users can:

- Discover and listen to podcasts
- Create and manage their own podcasts
- Comment on and like podcasts
- Communicate with experts and other users
- Browse expert profiles and connect with industry specialists
- Access comprehensive About and Contact pages

The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework. The frontend is built with React. Media files (like podcast images and expert profile pictures) are stored using Cloudinary.

## 🎨 Design Process

The design of the **Podcast Experts** platform follows a structured and user-centred approach.  
The goal was to create an interface that is clean, intuitive, and accessible across all device sizes.

### **1. Research & Planning**
- Analysed common patterns in podcast and expert-listing platforms  
- Defined the main user types: **Standard User** and **Expert**  
- Identified key features: browsing podcasts, creating profiles, messaging, and expert discovery

### **2. Wireframing**
Low-fidelity wireframes were created to define the layout and structure of each main page before proceeding to development.  
These wireframes helped visualise user flows and ensured consistent layout decisions across the platform.

👉 Wireframes are located in:  
`docs/design/wireframes/`

### **3. Layout Structure**
The layout is based on:
- Clear separation between content areas  
- Reusable UI components (cards, forms, modals, navbar)  
- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Prioritising readability and clarity over visual complexity  

### **4. UX Considerations**
- Clear navigation for new users  
- Consistent form behaviour across all pages  
- Immediate visual feedback for success and error states  
- Simple card-based listings for podcasts and experts  
- Accessible interactive elements (buttons, links, icons)

---

## 🎨 Colour Palette

The colour system focuses on simplicity, contrast, and readability.  
It helps provide a professional and trustworthy visual identity.

| Purpose | Colour | Hex |
|--------|--------|------|
| Primary Background | Dark Gray | **#1E1E1E** |
| Primary Text | White | **#FFFFFF** |
| Accent / Action | Blue | **#007BFF** |
| Secondary Background | Light Gray | **#F5F5F5** |
| Success | Green | **#28A745** |
| Error | Red | **#DC3545** |

**Design Goals:**  
- Ensure WCAG-friendly contrast  
- Make calls-to-action (CTAs) immediately visible  
- Support a clean, modern look for both light and dark sections

---

## ✒️ Typography

The platform uses a clean and modern sans-serif typeface designed for readability.

### **Font Family:**  
**Inter**, or fallback: `Arial`, `sans-serif`

### **Hierarchy**
- **Headings (H1, H2, H3):**  
  - Weight: 600–700  
  - Purpose: clear section breaks and logical page structure
- **Body Text:**  
  - Weight: 400  
  - Purpose: comfortable long-form reading
- **Buttons & Labels:**  
  - Slightly bolder for emphasis (500–600)

### **Spacing Rules**
- Consistent vertical spacing between sections  
- Generous padding around cards and form inputs  
- Minimum 16px base font size for accessibility  

---

---

## Installation (Local Setup)

### **Backend (Django + DRF)**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd podcast-experts-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata db_backup_cleaned.json  # Load sample data
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

## Frontend Deployment

The frontend of **Podcast Experts** is built using **React** and compiled into production-ready static files using:

```bash
npm run build

In production, the compiled React build is served by the Django backend through WhiteNoise, allowing a single Heroku application to host both the API and the frontend.
🚀 1. Local Production Build
Generate the production build:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
A build/ folder is created containing minified and production-ready static assets.
🗂 2. Serving the React Build with Django + WhiteNoise
Two supported methods:
A) Copy React build into Django static files
/backend
    /static
    /staticfiles
    /frontend_build   ← React build output
B) Serve the build folder directly
Update Django settings:
STATICFILES_DIRS
TEMPLATES
WhiteNoiseMiddleware
Both methods work seamlessly with WhiteNoise.
🔧 3. Frontend Environment Variables
React requires environment variables at build time:
Variable	Description
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL	URL of the deployed Django REST API
REACT_APP_WEBSITE_URL	Public frontend URL
Example:
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="https://your-api.com" \
REACT_APP_WEBSITE_URL="https://your-frontend.com" \
npm run build
These variables are embedded directly into the compiled React files.
☁️ 4. Deploying to Heroku
This project uses one Heroku app to serve both backend and frontend.
Step 1 — Include the latest build
git add frontend/build
git commit -m "Add updated React production build"
Step 2 — Deploy
git push heroku main
What Heroku does automatically:
Installs backend dependencies
Installs frontend dependencies (if configured)
Builds React (npm run build)
Runs collectstatic
Serves the app using WhiteNoise
Final deployed application:
https://your-heroku-app.herokuapp.com/
All React routes (e.g., /login, /podcasts, /about) are handled entirely through the compiled React build served by Django.
